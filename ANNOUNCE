Subject: [announce] ATLAPACK revision 3.5.0.2

		 LAPACK and LAPACKE with GNU Autotools
		 =====================================


LAPACK is a library of Fortran  90 with subroutines for solving the most
commonly  occurring  problems  in   numerical  linear  algebra.   It  is
freely-available software, and is copyrighted.

  This distribution  repackages the  original LAPACK and  LAPACKE source
code under the configuration and  installation framework provided by the
GNU Autotools.  It was last updated with LAPACK 3.5.0.

  ATLAPACK expects a BLAS library to be already installed on the system;
when  no optimised  library is  available, it  is suggested  to use  the
ATBLAS distribution.

  The last revision of this package is available from:

	   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/atlapack/files/>

the development of this package takes place at:

		<http://github.com/marcomaggi/atlapack/>

and as backup at:

	      <http://sourceforge.net/projects/atlapack/>

  The original  LAPACK and LAPACKE  distribution is available  on Netlib
and can be obtained via the World Wide Web and anonymous FTP:

Notes for revision 3.5.0.2
--------------------------

* The  directory  "scheme"  contains  a table  of  functions  in  Scheme
  symbolic expression form and a  demo program that automatically builds
  a Vicare Scheme binding for LAPACKE.  It should be easily adaptable to
  other Scheme implementations.
