1. Introduction
---------------

LAPACK is a library of Fortran  90 with subroutines for solving the most
commonly  occurring  problems  in   numerical  linear  algebra.   It  is
freely-available software, and is copyrighted.

  This distribution  repackages the  original LAPACK and  LAPACKE source
code under the configuration and  installation framework provided by the
GNU Autotools.  It was last updated with LAPACK 3.5.0.

  ATLAPACK expects a BLAS library to be already installed on the system;
when  no optimised  library is  available, it  is suggested  to use  the
ATBLAS distribution (see Resources below).

3. Install
----------

From a proper distribution tarball, we can do this, after extracting the
archive:

    $ cd atlapack-0.1.0
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must first run the  script "autogen.sh", from the  top source
directory,  to generate  the  needed files;  for this  we  need to  have
installed the GNU  Autotools: Automake, Autoconf, Libtool.   We may need
to manually run "libtoolize" the first time.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atlapack

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/atlapack

5. How to upgrade to a new LAPACK release
-----------------------------------------

It is a good idea to keep  the version of this package synchronised with
the version of the corresponding  LAPACK release.  The version number is
in the file "configure.ac".

  Let's say  the archive  of a new  release of LAPACK  is unpacked  in a
directory "newlapack" and  ATLAPACK is in the  directory "atlapack".  To
upgrade ATLAPACK with the new source files we do:

0.   Create  a   new  branch   in  the   git  repository,   for  example
   "upgrade-to-3.5.0", and check it out.

1. Copy the LAPACK Fortran source files:

    $ cp newlapack/SRC/*.f atlapack/lapack

2. Copy the LAPACK machine dependent files:

    $ cp newlapack/INSTALL/*.f atlapack/machine-dependent

3. Copy the LAPACKE include files:

    $ cp newlapack/lapacke/include/*.h atlapack/lapacke/src
    $ mv \
       lapacke/src/lapacke_mangling_with_flags.h \
       lapacke/src/lapacke_mangling.h

4. Copy the LAPACKE source files:

    $ cp newlapack/lapacke/include/*.c atlapack/lapacke/src

5. Copy the LAPACKE utils source files:

    $ cp newlapack/lapacke/utils/*.c atlapack/lapacke/utils

6. We can examine the list of new files with:

    $ git status

7. Update the  lists of files in  "atlapack/lapack/Makefile.am" with the
   lists of files from "newlapack/SRC/Makefile".

8. Update the lists of  files in "atlapack/lapacke/Makefile.am" with the
   lists    of   files    from   "newlapack/lapacke/src/Makefile"    and
   "newlapack/lapacke/src/Makefile".
