\fBSLAQR2\fP performs the orthogonal similarity transformation of a Hessenberg matrix to detect and deflate fully converged eigenvalues from a trailing principal submatrix (aggressive early deflation)\&.

\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
    SLAQR2 is identical to SLAQR3 except that it avoids
    recursion by calling SLAHQR instead of SLAQR4.

    Aggressive early deflation:

    This subroutine accepts as input an upper Hessenberg matrix
    H and performs an orthogonal similarity transformation
    designed to detect and deflate fully converged eigenvalues from
    a trailing principal submatrix.  On output H has been over-
    written by a new Hessenberg matrix that is a perturbation of
    an orthogonal similarity transformation of H.  It is to be
    hoped that the final version of H has many zero subdiagonal
    entries.

.RS 4
\fIWANTT\fP 
.PP
.nf
          WANTT is LOGICAL
          If .TRUE., then the Hessenberg matrix H is fully updated
          so that the quasi-triangular Schur factor may be
          computed (in cooperation with the calling subroutine).
          If .FALSE., then only enough of H is updated to preserve
          the eigenvalues.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIWANTZ\fP 
.PP
.nf
          WANTZ is LOGICAL
          If .TRUE., then the orthogonal matrix Z is updated so
          so that the orthogonal Schur factor may be computed
          (in cooperation with the calling subroutine).
          If .FALSE., then Z is not referenced.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fIN\fP

\fIKTOP\fP 
.PP
.nf
          KTOP is INTEGER
          It is assumed that either KTOP = 1 or H(KTOP,KTOP-1)=0.

.nf
          KBOT is INTEGER
          It is assumed without a check that either
          KBOT = N or H(KBOT+1,KBOT)=0.  KBOT and KTOP together
          determine an isolated block along the diagonal of the
          Hessenberg matrix.

          On input the initial N-by-N section of H stores the

          On output H has been transformed by an orthogonal
          similarity transformation, perturbed, and the returned
          to Hessenberg form that (it is to be hoped) has some
          zero subdiagonal entries.

          accumulated into Z(ILOZ:IHIZ,ILO:IHI) from the right.

          The real and imaginary parts of converged eigenvalues

          WORK is REAL array, dimension LWORK.

.PP
.nf
          LWORK is integer
          The dimension of the work array WORK.  LWORK = 2*NW
          suffices, but greater efficiency may result from larger
          values of LWORK.

          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; SLAQR2
          only estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
          values of N, NW, KTOP and KBOT.  The estimate is returned
          in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is issued
          by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
