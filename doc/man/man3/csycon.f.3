\fBPurpose: \fP
.RS 4

.PP
.nf
 CSYCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
 1-norm) of a complex symmetric matrix A using the factorization
 A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by CSYTRF.

 An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
 condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

.RS 4
\fIUPLO\fP 
.PP
.nf
          UPLO is CHARACTER*1
          Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
          as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
          = 'U':  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
          = 'L':  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.

.nf
          N is INTEGER
          The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

.br
\fIA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
          The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
          obtain the factor U or L as computed by CSYTRF.
.fi
.PP
.br
\fILDA\fP 
.PP
.nf
          LDA is INTEGER

\fIRCOND\fP 
.PP
.nf
          RCOND is REAL
          The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
          computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
          estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
