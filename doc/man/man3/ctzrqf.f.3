 This routine is deprecated and has been replaced by routine CTZRZF.

 CTZRQF reduces the M-by-N ( M<=N ) complex upper trapezoidal matrix A
 to upper triangular form by means of unitary transformations.

 The upper trapezoidal matrix A is factored as

    A = ( R  0 ) * Z,

 where Z is an N-by-N unitary matrix and R is an M-by-M upper
 triangular matrix.

  The  factorization is obtained by Householder's method.  The kth
  transformation matrix, Z( k ), whose conjugate transpose is used to
  introduce zeros into the (m - k + 1)th row of A, is given in the form

     Z( k ) = ( I     0   ),
              ( 0  T( k ) )

  where

     T( k ) = I - tau*u( k )*u( k )**H,   u( k ) = (   1    ),
                                                   (   0    )
                                                   ( z( k ) )

  tau is a scalar and z( k ) is an ( n - m ) element vector.
  tau and z( k ) are chosen to annihilate the elements of the kth row
  of X.

  The scalar tau is returned in the kth element of TAU and the vector
  u( k ) in the kth row of A, such that the elements of z( k ) are
  in  a( k, m + 1 ), ..., a( k, n ). The elements of R are returned in
  the upper triangular part of A.

  Z is given by

     Z =  Z( 1 ) * Z( 2 ) * ... * Z( m ).
